                    In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Wichita, Kansas. They<br> named it Pizza Hut, because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the<br> restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were<br> treated like family. And we’ve been delivering that same food and service ever since.

                    From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest<br> pizza in town — because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those<br> farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients<br> we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut. That’s why pizza is in our<br> name — and always will be.
